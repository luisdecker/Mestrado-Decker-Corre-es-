  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new method for detecting and recognizing text in complex images and video frames. Text detection is performed in a two-step approach that combines the speed of a text localization step, enabling text size normalization, with the strength of a machine learning text verification step applied on background independent features. Text recognition, applied on the detected text lines, is addressed by a text segmentation step followed by an traditional OCR algorithm within a multi-hypotheses framework relying on multiple segments, language modeling and OCR statistics. Experiments conducted on large databases of real broadcast documents demonstrate the validity of our approach.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new scene text dataset named Downtown Osaka Scene Text Dataset (in short, DOST dataset). The dataset consists of sequential images captured in shopping streets in downtown Osaka with an omnidirectional camera. Unlike most of existing datasets consisting of scene images intentionally captured, DOST dataset consists of uncontrolled scene images; use of an omnidirectional camera enabled us to capture videos (sequential images) of whole scenes surrounding the camera. Since the dataset preserved the real scenes containing texts as they were, in other words, they are scene texts in the wild. DOST dataset contained 32,147 manually ground truthed sequential images. They contained 935,601 text regions consisting of 797,919 legible and 137,682 illegible. The legible regions contained 2,808,340 characters. The dataset is evaluated using two existing scene text detection methods and one powerful commercial end-to-end scene text recognition method to know the difficulty and quality in comparison with existing datasets.},

  Abstract                 = {Common benchmark datasets, standardized performance metrics, and baseline algorithms have demonstrated considerable impact on research and development in a variety of application domains. These resources provide both consumers and developers of technology with a common framework to objectively compare the performance of different algorithms and algorithmic improvements. In this paper, we present such a framework for evaluating object detection and tracking in video: specifically for face, text, and vehicle objects. This framework includes the source video data, ground-truth annotations (along with guidelines for annotation), performance metrics, evaluation protocols, and tools including scoring software and baseline algorithms. For each detection and tracking task and supported domain, we developed a 50-clip training set and a 50-clip test set. Each data clip is approximately 2.5 minutes long and has been completely spatially/temporally annotated at the I-frame level. Each task/domain, therefore, has an associated annotated corpus of approximately 450,000 frames. The scope of such annotation is unprecedented and was designed to begin to support the necessary quantities of data for robust machine learning approaches, as well as a statistically significant comparison of the performance of algorithms. The goal of this work was to systematically address the challenges of object detection and tracking through a common evaluation framework that permits a meaningful objective comparison of techniques, provides the research community with sufficient data for the exploration of automatic modeling techniques, encourages the incorporation of objective evaluation into the development process, and contributes useful lasting resources of a scale and magnitude that will prove to be extremely useful to the computer vision research community for years to come.},

After that, feature extraction techniques are applied to get features that will be useful in classifying and recognition of images. Feature extraction techniques are helpful in various image processing applications e.g. character recognition. As features define the behavior of an image, they show its place in terms of storage taken, efficiency in classification and obviously in time consumption also. Here in this paper, we are going to discuss various types of features, feature extraction techniques and explaining in what scenario, which features extraction technique, will be better. Hereby in this paper, we are going to refer features and feature extraction methods in case of character recognition application.},

  Abstract                 = {The wide-baseline stereo problem, i.e. the problem of establishing correspondences between a pair of images taken from different viewpoints is studied. A new set of image elements that are put into correspondence, the so called extremal regions, is introduced. Extremal regions possess highly desirable properties: the set is closed under (1) continuous (and thus projective) transformation of image coordinates and (2) monotonic transformation of image intensities. An efficient (near linear complexity) and practically fast detection algorithm (near frame rate) is presented for an affinely invariant stable subset of extremal regions, the maximally stable extremal regions (MSER). A new robust similarity measure for establishing tentative correspondences is proposed. The robustness ensures that invariants from multiple measurement regions (regions obtained by invariant constructions from extremal regions), some that are significantly larger (and hence discriminative) than the MSERs, may be used to establish tentative correspondences. The high utility of MSERs, multiple measurement regions and the robust metric is demonstrated in wide-baseline experiments on image pairs from both indoor and outdoor scenes. Significant change of scale (3.5�), illumination conditions, out-of-plane rotation, occlusion, locally anisotropic scale change and 3D translation of the viewpoint are all present in the test problems. Good estimates of epipolar geometry (average distance from corresponding points to the epipolar line below 0.09 of the inter-pixel distance) are obtained.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently growing attention has been paid to recognizing text in natural images. Natural image text OCR is far more complex than OCR in scanned documents. Text in real world environments appears in arbitrary colors, font sizes and font types, often affected by perspective distortion, lighting effects, textures or occlusion. Currently there are no datasets publicly available which cover all aspects of natural image OCR. We propose a comprehensive well-annotated configurable dataset for optical character recognition in natural images for the evaluation and comparison of approaches tackling with natural image text OCR. Based on the rich annotations of the proposed NEOCR dataset new and more precise evaluations are now possible, which give more detailed information on where improvements are most required in natural image text OCR.},

  Abstract                 = {An end-to-end real-time scene text localization and recognition method is presented. The real-time performance is achieved by posing the character detection problem as an efficient sequential selection from the set of Extremal Regions (ERs). The ER detector is robust to blur, illumination, color and texture variation and handles low-contrast text. In the first classification stage, the probability of each ER being a character is estimated using novel features calculated with O(1) complexity per region tested. Only ERs with locally maximal probability are selected for the second stage, where the classification is improved using more computationally expensive features. A highly efficient exhaustive search with feedback loops is then applied to group ERs into words and to select the most probable character segmentation. Finally, text is recognized in an OCR stage trained using synthetic fonts. The method was evaluated on two public datasets. On the ICDAR 2011 dataset, the method achieves state-of-the-art text localization results amongst published methods and it is the first one to report results for end-to-end text recognition. On the more challenging Street View Text dataset, the method achieves state-of-the-art recall. The robustness of the proposed method against noise and low contrast of characters is demonstrated by ''false positives'' caused by detected watermark text in the dataset.},

The new algorithm provides exactly identical results in true worst-case linear time. Moreover, the new algorithm uses significantly less memory and has better cache-locality, resulting in faster execution. Our CPU implementation performs twice as fast as a state-of-the-art FPGA implementation based on the standard algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {Many methods have been recently proposed to deal with the large amount of data provided by the new remote sensing technologies. Several of those methods rely on the use of segmented regions. However, a common issue in region-based applications is the definition of the appropriate representation scale of the data, a problem usually addressed by exploiting multiple scales of segmentation. The use of multiple scales, however, raises new challenges related to the definition of effective and efficient mechanisms for extracting features. In this paper, we address the problem of extracting features from a hierarchy by proposing two approaches that exploit the existing relationships among regions at different scales. The H-Propagation propagates any histogram-based low-level descriptors. The bag-of-visual-word (BoW)-Propagation approach uses the BoWs model to propagate features along multiple scales. The proposed methods are very efficient, as features need to be extracted only at the base of the hierarchy and yield comparable results to low-level extraction approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a method for spotting words in the wild, i.e., in real images taken in unconstrained environments. Text found in the wild has a surprising range of difficulty. At one end of the spectrum, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) applied to scanned pages of well formatted printed text is one of the most successful applications of computer vision to date. At the other extreme lie visual CAPTCHAs -- text that is constructed explicitly to fool computer vision algorithms. Both tasks involve recognizing text, yet one is nearly solved while the other remains extremely challenging. In this work, we argue that the appearance of words in the wild spans this range of difficulties and propose a new word recognition approach based on state-of-the-art methods from generic object recognition, in which we consider object categories to be the words themselves. We compare performance of leading OCR engines -- one open source and one proprietary -- with our new approach on the ICDAR Robust Reading dataset and a new word spotting dataset we introduce in this paper: the Street View Text dataset. We show improvements of up to 16{\%} on the datasets, demonstrating the feasibility of a new approach to a seemingly old problem.},

  Abstract                 = {Evaluation of object detection algorithms is a non-trivial task: a detection result is usually evaluated by comparing the bounding box of the detected object with the bounding box of the ground truth object. The commonly used precision and recall measures are computed from the overlap area of these two rectangles. However, these measures have several drawbacks: they don't give intuitive information about the proportion of the correctly detected objects and the number of false alarms, and they cannot be accumulated across multiple images without creating ambiguity in their interpretation. Furthermore, quantitative and qualitative evaluation is often mixed resulting in ambiguous measures.},

In this paper, we propose a discriminative approach that integrates appearance and consensus features for robust scene text detection. We propose an integrated discrimination model to perform text classification as well as control component grouping. We design shape, stroke and structural features to describe text component appearance and the consensus among them. Experimental results on three public datasets show that the proposed approach is robust to cluttered backgrounds, and is applicable in multilingual environments.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a camera-based assistive text reading framework to help blind persons read text labels and product packaging from hand-held objects in their daily lives. To isolate the object from cluttered backgrounds or other surrounding objects in the camera view, we first propose an efficient and effective motion-based method to define a region of interest (ROI) in the video by asking the user to shake the object. This method extracts moving object region by a mixture-of-Gaussians-based background subtraction method. In the extracted ROI, text localization and recognition are conducted to acquire text information. To automatically localize the text regions from the object ROI, we propose a novel text localization algorithm by learning gradient features of stroke orientations and distributions of edge pixels in an Adaboost model. Text characters in the localized text regions are then binarized and recognized by off-the-shelf optical character recognition software. The recognized text codes are output to blind users in speech. Performance of the proposed text localization algorithm is quantitatively evaluated on ICDAR-2003 and ICDAR-2011 Robust Reading Datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves the state of the arts. The proof-of-concept prototype is also evaluated on a dataset collected using ten blind persons to evaluate the effectiveness of the system's hardware. We explore user interface issues and assess robustness of the algorithm in extracting and reading text from different objects with complex backgrounds.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, a variety of real-world applications have triggered huge demand for techniques that can extract textual information from natural scenes. Therefore, scene text detection and recognition have become active research topics in computer vision. In this work, we investigate the problem of scene text detection from an alternative perspective and propose a novel algorithm for it. Different from traditional methods, which mainly make use of the properties of single characters or strokes, the proposed algorithm exploits the symmetry property of character groups and allows for direct extraction of text lines from natural images. The experiments on the latest ICDAR benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, compared to conventional approaches, the proposed algorithm shows stronger adaptability to texts in challenging scenarios.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we propose an unconventional approach for text detection in natural images. Both global and local cues are taken into account for localizing text lines in a coarse-to-fine procedure. First, a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) model is trained for predicting a salient map of text regions in a holistic manner. Then, a set of hypotheses text lines are estimated by combining the salient map and MSER components. Finally, another FCN classifier is used for predicting the centroid of each character, in order to remove the false hypotheses. The framework is general for handling texts in multiple orientations, languages and fonts. The proposed method consistently achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three text detection benchmarks: MSRA-TD500, ICDAR2015, and ICDAR2013.},

abstract={In this paper we describe a new mobile architecture, MobileNetV2, that improves the state of the art performance of mobile models on multiple tasks and benchmarks as well as across a spectrum of different model sizes. We also describe efficient ways of applying these mobile models to object detection in a novel framework we call SSDLite. Additionally, we demonstrate how to build mobile semantic segmentation models through a reduced form of DeepLabv3 which we call Mobile DeepLabv3. is based on an inverted residual structure where the shortcut connections are between the thin bottleneck layers. The intermediate expansion layer uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features as a source of non-linearity. Additionally, we find that it is important to remove non-linearities in the narrow layers in order to maintain representational power. We demonstrate that this improves performance and provide an intuition that led to this design. Finally, our approach allows decoupling of the input/output domains from the expressiveness of the transformation, which provides a convenient framework for further analysis. We measure our performance on ImageNet [1] classification, COCO object detection [2], VOC image segmentation [3]. We evaluate the trade-offs between accuracy, and number of operations measured by multiply-adds (MAdd), as well as actual latency, and the number of parameters.},

  abstract  = {We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. SSD is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stages and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has competitive accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. For {\$}{\$}300 {\backslash}times 300{\$}{\$}300{\texttimes}300input, SSD achieves 74.3�{\%} mAP on VOC2007 test at 59�FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for {\$}{\$}512 {\backslash}times 512{\$}{\$}512{\texttimes}512input, SSD achieves 76.9�{\%} mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy even with a smaller input image size. Code is available at https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd.},
